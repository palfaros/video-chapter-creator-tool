# Video Chapter Creator Tool

Pablo Alfaro Saracho, 2022

## Summary

A tool to automatically create a chapter file from a video, e.g., a TV show episode or a movie.

## Description

The chapters are generated by searching sequences of consecutive black frames in a video, which often indicates the end of a chapter and the beginning of the following one. The tool searchs silences inside those black frames sequences. The detected chapter for a black frame sequence corresponds to the first silent audio sample found in it.

I use ```cv2``` (OpenCV) library to get the frame rate of the video and read every frame. I simultaneously use ```numpy``` to calculate the average of read frames in order to select black frames. Then I use ```soundfile``` library to read the audio track (```.wav``` file is generated previously using ```ffmpeg``` from command line with ```subprocess``` library). Silences are searched also using ```numpy``` but only with audio samples inside sequences of black frames. The ```mkvmerge``` compatible ```.xml``` chapter file is built using ```lxml```  library.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [ffmepg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
* Windows 10, Linux

### Installing



```
git clone https://github.com/palfaros/video-chapter-creator-tool.git
```

### Executing program

This tool requires a video file and its audio track separately. Video must be ```.mp4``` or ```.avi``` only.
```
video_chapter_creator_tool.py -v S0xEyy.avi -a S0xEyy_Track01.ac3
```
The tool allows to use video and audio files with different framerate. The audio track framerate is set to be the final framerate of the chapter file. To use this feature, the old framerate (video) and the new framerate (audio) must be specified. For example, if video framerate is 25 fps and audio framerate is 23.976:
```
video_chapter_creator_tool.py -v S0xEyy.avi -a S0xEyy_Track01.ac3 -f 25.000 23.976
```

## Help

Run the ```video_chapter_creator_tool.py``` script with --help for usage information.

```
video_chapter_creator_tool.py --help
```

Output:

```
usage: video_chapter_creator_tool.py [-h] -v VIDEO_FILE -a AUDIO_FILE [-f FRAMERATE FRAMERATE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v VIDEO_FILE, --video-file VIDEO_FILE
  -a AUDIO_FILE, --audio-file AUDIO_FILE
  -f FRAMERATE FRAMERATE, --framerate FRAMERATE FRAMERATE
```
